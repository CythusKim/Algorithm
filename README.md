# Algorithm

I started a reivew project in 2018 fall, and this is the first step of it.
I tried to implement algorithms for cs problems dealt wihtin a lecture from SNU ON.
The name of the lecture is "Intro to Algorithm".

Type "make" to compile, and then you will see Algorithm.class file which is the main program.
You can specify which algorithm you want to execute; just put a number as an argument.
Numbers are listed below (Table of Contents).
For example, if you want to execute Heapsort algorithm, type "java Algorithm 2".



# Table of Contents
1. Maximum Subarray Problem
2. Heapsort
